After graduating from the game engineering department, I am currently working as a server developer at a game company. I have gained a variety of experiences from the early stages of game development to launch and live service and I am interested not only in server development but also in client-side development.

I am always trying to learn because I am interested in all areas of software engineering. Recently, I'm interested in algorithms and studying them. 

I think a talented developer is someone who can show and prove his or her skills directly. I am constantly learning and growing to become the best developer.
