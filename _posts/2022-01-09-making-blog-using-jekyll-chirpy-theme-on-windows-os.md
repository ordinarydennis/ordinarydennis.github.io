## Introduction
As I started the github blog again, I would like to share the difficulties that I faced while setting up my blog.<br>
Among many [jekyll themes](https://jekyll-themes.com/free/), I like [Chirpy](https://jekyll-themes.com/chirpy/) theme the most and I chose this them this time. 

Other Jekyll themes could be used by fork to their own github repository and only by entering their blog url in _config.yml.
but the chirpy theme couldn't be set up that easily.<br><br>

## Fork to Your Repository
Once, fork Chirpy theme source code to your github repository. 
![image_fork_1]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2022-01-09-making-blog-using-jekyll-chirpy-theme-on-windows-os/fork_1.png)

And go to settings then change repository name to <span style="color:orange">[your github id].github.io</span>

If you have moved the blog code to your repository as above, Now let's clone it to your local computer.
![image_clone]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2022-01-09-making-blog-using-jekyll-chirpy-theme-on-windows-os/clone.png){: width="300" height="300"){: .left}<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Edit _config.yml
Open _config.yml file and edit some settings
- title : Your Blog title.
- url:  Your blog url. <span style="color:orange">(the most important)</span> 
- avatar: your blog avatar image.   
<br><br>

## Installation Ruby
I install [Windows OS version of Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) because I have Windows OS.<br>
![image_installation_ruby]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2022-01-09-making-blog-using-jekyll-chirpy-theme-on-windows-os/installation_ruby.png){: width="300" height="300"){: .left}<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

After installation ruby, Enter number 3 in console window as below.<br>
![image_ruby_console]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2022-01-09-making-blog-using-jekyll-chirpy-theme-on-windows-os/ruby_console.png){: width="300" height="300"){: .left}<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
