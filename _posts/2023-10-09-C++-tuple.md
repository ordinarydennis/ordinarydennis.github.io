When you wanna deal with multiple types, what should you do? There are likely various ways but among them, today, I am going to discuss about <b>std::tuple</b>.
<br><br>

<h2> Why you use std::tuple </h2>
Suppose you need to create a function to return system information.

```cpp
int GetSystemInfo()
{
	int systemNum = 1;
	return systemNum;
}
```

Good! However, if you have to return a system name as well, how do you return a system name? 

```cpp
int GetSystemInfo(std::string& systemName)
{
	systemName = "test system";
	int systemNum = 1;
	return systemNum;
}
```

Oh! Great! However, if you need to return multiple system information, how should you return them? The first approach is to create struct or class.

```cpp
struct SystemInfo
{
	int num = 0;
	std::string name;
}

SystemInfo GetSystemInfo(std::string& systemName....)
{
	SystemInfo systemInfo;
	systemInfo.num = 1;
	systemInfo.name = "test";
	...
	return systemInfo;
}
```

In code above, I created SystemInfo struct and added member variables about system information. When creating a struct or class, it is common to create a header file and a cpp file but it is inconvenient.

<h2> How to use std::tuple </h2>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <tuple>
#include <string>

std::tuple<int, std::string, int> GetSystemInfo()
{
	//tuple initialization
	//std::tuple<int, std::string, int> systemInfo = { 1, "test", 10 };

	std::tuple<int, std::string, int> systemInfo;
	
	systemInfo = std::make_tuple(1, "test", 10);

	return systemInfo;
}

int main()
{
	auto systemInfo = GetSystemInfo();

	//get information from tuple.
	int num = std::get<0>(systemInfo);
	std::string name = std::get<1>(systemInfo);
	int id = std::get<2>(systemInfo);

	//ouput system information
	std::cout<< "num: " << num << std::endl;
	std::cout<< "name: " << name << std::endl;
	std::cout<< "id: " << id << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```
I have modified the GetSystemInfo() function to return system information using std::tuple. There are two methods to create std::tuple variable. The first one is initialization. 

```cpp
//tuple initialization
std::tuple<int, std::string, int> systemInfo = { 1, "test", 10 };
```
When you initialize std::tuple, all you need to list values of tuple in initialization statement. At this point, the types listed in the tuple must match the type of value.<br>

The second one is to use std::make_tuple() function. you can assign values to std::tuple variable using std::make_tuple() function. Like when initializing, the types in tuple must match the types of values.

```cpp
std::tuple<int, std::string, int> systemInfo;
systemInfo = std::make_tuple(1, "test", 10);
```

If you created a tuple and assigned values, Let’s use the tuple! How to get value from tuple variable is to use std::get<>() template function.

```cpp
auto systemInfo = GetSystemInfo();

//get information from tuple.
int num = std::get<0>(systemInfo);
std::string name = std::get<1>(systemInfo);
int id = std::get<2>(systemInfo);

//ouput system information
std::cout<< "num: " << num << std::endl;
std::cout<< "name: " << name << std::endl;
std::cout<< "id: " << id << std::endl;
```

The first argument of get<>() is index of the type that you want to get value from tuple.

<b>Structured binding (since C++ 17)</b><br>
Since C++ 17,  structured binding has been added. It makes std::tuple easy to use.

```cpp
auto systemInfo = GetSystemInfo();

//Structured binding
auto [num, name, id] = systemInfo;

//ouput system information
std::cout<< "num: " << num << std::endl;
std::cout<< "name: " << name << std::endl;
std::cout<< "id: " << id << std::endl;
```

The structured binding statement is easy to use, all you need to list the name of variables. However, in case of using a structured binding statement, you need to assign all variables of the tuple. You cannot get only some variables from the tuple.
<br><br>

<h2> Other Features </h2>

<h3>std::tie()</h3>
This function assigns the value of tuple to variables. You can use tie() when you want to reuse variables.

```cpp
// std::tie may work together with C++17 structured bindings: //

auto position = [](int w) { return std::tuple<int, int>{ 1 * w, 2 * w }; };

auto [x, y] = position(1);
assert(x == 1 and y == 2);
// ...
std::tie(x, y) = position(2); // reuse x, y with tie
assert(x == 2 and y == 4);

// sub-types that are returned by a callable may differ
auto coordinates = [] { return std::tuple<char, short>(6, 9); };
// ...
std::tie(x, y) = coordinates(); // implicit conversions
assert(x == 6 and y == 9);
```

<h3>std::tuple_cat()</h3>
Constructs a tuple that is a concatenation of all tuples 

```cpp
std::tuple<int, std::string, float> t1(10, "Test", 3.14);
int n = 7;
auto t2 = std::tuple_cat(t1, std::make_tuple("Foo", "bar"), t1, std::tie(n));
n = 42;
print(t2);
```
output:
```
(10, Test, 3.14, Foo, bar, 10, Test, 3.14, 42)
```

<h3>std::tuple::swap()</h3>
Swap tuples each other.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <tuple>
 
int main()
{
    std::tuple<int, std::string, float>
                      p1{42, "ABCD", 2.71},
                      p2;
    p2 = std::make_tuple(10, "1234", 3.14);
 
    auto print_p1_p2 = [&](auto rem)
    {
        std::cout << rem
                  << "p1 = {" << std::get<0>(p1)
                  << ", "     << std::get<1>(p1)
                  << ", "     << std::get<2>(p1) << "}, "
                  << "p2 = {" << std::get<0>(p2)
                  << ", "     << std::get<1>(p2)
                  << ", "     << std::get<2>(p2) << "}\n";
    };
 
    print_p1_p2("Before p1.swap(p2): ");
    p1.swap(p2);
    print_p1_p2("After  p1.swap(p2): ");
    swap(p1, p2);
    print_p1_p2("After swap(p1, p2): ");
}
```
output:
```
Before p1.swap(p2): p1 = {42, ABCD, 2.71}, p2 = {10, 1234, 3.14}
After  p1.swap(p2): p1 = {10, 1234, 3.14}, p2 = {42, ABCD, 2.71}
After swap(p1, p2): p1 = {42, ABCD, 2.71}, p2 = {10, 1234, 3.14}
```

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
Today, we discussed about std::tuple. I think the tuple is very useful feature in C++. I recommend using tuple with ‘auto’ keyword. It makes code easy to use and concise.
