<h2> Discription </h2>
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.
<br>

<b>Example 1:</b><br>
![example1]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2024-02-03-LeeCode-82.-Remove-Duplicates-from-Sorted-List-II/example1.png){: width="500" height="500"){: .center}
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
```
<br>

<b>Example 2</b>:<br>
![example2]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2024-02-03-LeeCode-82.-Remove-Duplicates-from-Sorted-List-II/example2.png){: width="400" height="300"){: .center}
```
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```
<br>

<b>Constraints:</b>
* The number of nodes in the list is in the range (0, 300).
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
* The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

<h2> Intuition </h2>

The intuition of this problem is to remove nodes that have value duplicated in a linked list and reconnect linked list.<br>
To solve this problem, you should traverse the linked list and keep track of the starting and ending nodes that do not have duplicated values.
<br><br>

<h2> Approach </h2>

The key point in a linked list problem is creating previous node and set previouse node 's next node to point to the head node.
It is because previous node is requried when you disconnect and reconnect the linked list. Let me show you steps to solve this problem below.

1. Creating previouse node that points to head node.

2. Find starting node with value duplicated. (If the value of the current node is the same as the value of the next node.)

3. Find the next node of ending node with value duplicated.
3-1. If there are nodes with value duplicated, remove all nodes with duplicated value and set next node to previous node's next node.
3-2. Otherwise, set current node to previous node.

4. Set next node to current node.

5. Repeat 1~4 until no next node.
<br><br>


<h2> Solution </h2>

```cpp
class Solution {
public:

	ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {

		ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
		ListNode* pre = dummy;
		ListNode* cur = head;
		
		while (cur)
		{
			auto* next = cur->next;

			while (next && cur->val == next->val)
			{
				auto* temp = next;
				next = next->next;
				delete temp;
			}

			//no nodes that have value duplicated
			if (cur->next == next)
			{
				pre = cur;
			}
			//if there are nodes with value duplicated
			//need to delete current node because it has same value also.
			else
			{
				delete cur;
				pre->next = next;
			}

			cur = next;
		}

		return dummy->next;
	}
};
```
<br>

As I said above, It is the most important to create previous node in linked list problem. Therefore create a dummy node to point to head and set the pre node to point the dummy node.

```cpp
ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
ListNode* pre = dummy;
ListNode* cur = head;
```

![create_pre_node]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2024-02-03-LeeCode-82.-Remove-Duplicates-from-Sorted-List-II/create_pre_node.png){: width="700" height="300"){: .center}
<br><br>

```cpp
auto* next = cur->next;

while (next && cur->val == next->val)
{
	auto* temp = next;
	next = next->next;
	delete temp;
}
```
Compare the value of current node with the value of next node, and
if they are equal, delete the memory of next node and set next node to point to the next node of next node to explore the next node. You can see that the node with same value is deleted in the code above.

![find_next_node]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2024-02-03-LeeCode-82.-Remove-Duplicates-from-Sorted-List-II/find_next_node.png){: width="700" height="300"){: .center}

When you find all node with same value, the next node will point to next node of last node with same value.
<br><br>

```cpp
//no nodes that have value duplicated
if (cur->next == next)
{
	pre = cur;
}
//if there are nodes with value duplicated
//need to delete current node because it has same value also.
else
{
	delete cur;
	pre->next = next;
}

cur = next;
```
This code is the most important code to solve this problem.
If there are no nodes with same value, we just set current node to previous node. The code "if (cur->next == next)" means that there are no nodes with same value between current node and next node.

On the other hand, As the figure above, if there are nodes with same value(1), current node must also be deleted. This is because this problem is to delete all nodes with the same value.

![delete_current_node]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2024-02-03-LeeCode-82.-Remove-Duplicates-from-Sorted-List-II/delete_current_node.png){: width="700" height="300"){: .center}
<br><br>

```cpp
pre->next = next;
```
Since all nodes with same value including current node are deleted, 
we need to set previous node again.

![reset_pre_node]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2024-02-03-LeeCode-82.-Remove-Duplicates-from-Sorted-List-II/reset_pre_node.png){: width="500" height="200"){: .center}

```cpp
cur = next;
```
Finally, set next node to current node so that you can explore the next node.
<br><br>


<h2> Complexity Analysis </h2>

* Time complexity: $O(N)$
  <br> The time complexity is n, which is the number of nodes in the linked list, because this solution simply traverses and deletes all nodes in the linked list.

* Space complexity: $O(1)$
  <br> The space complexity is $O(1)$ because it uses no additional memory.
<br><br>


<h2> Conclusion </h2>

The key point of linked list problem is creating previous node because almost linked list problems request you to disconnect and reconnect linked list. Therefore create dummy node to point to head node and use it as previous node at first.
