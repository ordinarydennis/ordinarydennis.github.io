<h2> Discription </h2>
A sequence `x1, x2, ..., xn` is *Fibonacci-like* if:

- `n >= 3`
- `xi + xi+1 == xi+2` for all `i + 2 <= n`

Given a <b>strictly increasing</b> array `arr` of positive integers forming a sequence, return <b>the length</b> of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of `arr`. If one does not exist, return `0`.

A <b>subsequence</b> is derived from another sequence `arr` by deleting any number of elements (including none) from `arr`, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3, 5, 8]` is a subsequence of `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.


Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].

```
Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].
```

<b>Constraints:</b>
- `3 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] < arr[i + 1] <= 109`

<h2> Analysis </h2>
This problem is to find the length of the longest Fibonacci subsequence of arr. Fibonacci sequence has the characteristic that the sum of two adjacent terms is next term. For example, if starting with 2,3, the Fibonacci sequence is as follows.

```
2,3,5,8,13,21...
```
<br><br>

<h2> Solution </h2>

```cpp
//Approach 1: Brute Force with Set
class Solution {

public:
	int lenLongestFibSubseq(vector<int>& arr) {

		std::unordered_set<int> m(arr.begin(), arr.end());

		int ret = 0;

		for (int a = 0; a < arr.size(); a++)
		{
			for (int b = a + 1; b < arr.size() - 1; b++)
			{
				int n1 = arr[a];
				int n2 = arr[b];
				int f = n1 + n2;

				int count = 0;

				while (m.count(f))
				{
					n1 = n2;
					n2 = f;
					f = n1 + n2;

					count++;
				}

				ret = std::max(ret, count);
			}
		}

		return 0 == ret ? 0 : ret + 2;
	}
};
```
In this code, the std::unordered_set<int> variable was initialized taking the value from the arr. It will be used to find the sum of two adjacent terms. 
<br><br>

```cpp
for (int a = 0; a < arr.size(); a++)
{
	for (int b = a + 1; b < arr.size() - 1; b++)
	{
		int n1 = arr[a];
		int n2 = arr[b];
		int f = n1 + n2;

		int count = 0;

		while (m.count(f))
		{
			n1 = n2;
			n2 = f;
			f = n1 + n2;

			count++;
		}

		ret = std::max(ret, count);
	}
}
```
This part is to find the longest length of fibonacci sub sequence. Determine two starting values by using two nested loops. The while loop statement calculates the length of Fibonacci sub sequence. 
<br><br>

```cpp
while (m.count(f))
{
	n1 = n2;
	n2 = f;
	f = n1 + n2;

	count++;
}
```
This is important code. If the sum(variable f) of n1 and n2 is in the ‘m’ variable, it tries to find the next term by using the sum found before. At this point, it is important to update two values(n1, n2) previous to find next term. This process is repeated until the next value does not exist in arr.
<br><br>

```cpp
return 0 == ret ? 0 : ret + 2;
```
If ret variable is 0, it means there is no finonacci sub sequence. Otherwise, add 2 to the ret variable because Fibonacci sub sequence consists of more than two values basically.

<h2> Complexity Analysis </h2>

<b> Time Complexity </b><br>
$O(N^2log⁡M)$ where N is the length of A, and M is the maximum value of A.
In the first for loop, It is repeated as much as the size of the arr and it is repeated as much as the size of the arr in the second loop as well. It means the time complexity of the nested loop is $O(n^2)$. $log⁡(M)$ means that the time complexity of the while loop statement. why the time complexity of the while loop statement is $log⁡(M)$? Let's look at the figure below.

In the graph above, as the sequence number increases, you can observe that the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. The shape of the Fibonacci sequence graph resembles that of an exponential function, and this is a characteristic feature of the sequence. In fibonacci sequence, as calculating next term by summing the largest two terms, the sequence grows exponentially. Therefore, we can represent the Fibonacci sequence with the following equation.

<p style="text-align: center;"> $y = a^x$ </p>

In above equation, the <b>`y`</b> represents the Fibonacci number and the <b>`x`</b> represents the sequence number. In above solution, because the time complexity of the while loop statement represents <b>`x`</b>, we can change the equation to logarithm as follows. 
<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">$x = log_a(y)$</p>

It means that as finding a specific the Fibonacci number <b>`y`</b>, we need to repeat <b>`x`</b> times. As a result, the time complexity of the solution becomes 
<p style="text-align: center;"> $O(N^2log⁡M)$. </p>
<br>

<b> Space Complexity </b><br>
The space complexity is $O(N)$. In above solution, <b>`unordered_set<int>`</b> container is used to find a Fibonacci number rapldly. Becuase the container is assigned as much as the size of arr, the space complexity is $O(N)$.
<br><br>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
The reason I'm posting this today is because calculating the time complexity of the Fibonacci sequence was challenging. As you can see, the growth rate of the Fibonacci sequence is similar to that of an exponential function. I didn’t know why the complexity was log(M) when calculating Fibonacci sequence at first. I studied about relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions while posting this article and it helped me understand the time complexity of exponential algorithm. I hope that this article help you as well.
