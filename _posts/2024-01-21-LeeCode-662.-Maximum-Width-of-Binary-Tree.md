<h2> Discription </h2>
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.

The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

```
Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).

```
Input: root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the fourth level with length 7 (6,null,null,null,null,null,7).

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2).
```


<b>Constraints:</b>
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range (1 ~ 3000).
* k100 <= Node.val <= 100

<h2> Intuition </h2>

When you encounter a problem that requires you to calculate for each level of the tree, you can usually solve it using a queue.
This problem is no exception. It is a problem to find the maximum width of a tree.
To find the maximum width of the tree, you need to traverse the tree using breadth-first search.
In order to traverse the tree using bfs, the queue algoritm is typically used.
<br><br>

<h2> Approach </h2>

Here are the two most crucial things you need to understand to solve this problem:
1. Traverse the tree using breadth-first search (BFS).<br>
As mentioned earlier, This problem needs to be solved using BFS. 
Therefore, to traverse using BFS, you need to use a queue 
<br>

2. Maintain an index for each node.<br>
The most important thing is to determine the index for each node and 
calculate the difference between the leftmost and rightmost nodes.
<br><br>

<h2> Solution </h2>

```cpp
class Solution {

public:
	int widthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {

		queue<pair<TreeNode*, long long>> que;

		que.push({ root, 0 });

		int ret = 0;

		while (que.size())
		{
			int sz = static_cast<int>(que.size());

			auto first = que.front().second;

			int diff = 0;

			for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++)
			{
				auto p = que.front();
				que.pop();

				auto k = p.second - first;

				if (sz - 1 == i)
				{
					diff = k;
				}

				if (p.first->left)
				{
					que.push({ p.first->left , (2 * k) + 1 });
				}
				if (p.first->right)
				{
					que.push({ p.first->right , (2 * k) + 2 });
				}
			}

			ret = std::max(ret, diff + 1 /* width */);
		}

		return ret;
	}
};
```
In this code, you'll initially encounter a queue.
```cpp
queue<pair<TreeNode*, long long>> que;
```
The queue consists of pair representing a pointer and the index of the node. 
Index represents the absolute index, not the relative index of a node in a binary search tree.
for example, in the figure below, the node which has value 9 is third in the level 3 of the tree but the index of node is 4. <br>
![example1]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2024-01-21-LeeCode-662.-Maximum-Width-of-Binary-Tree/example1.png){: width="300" height="300"){: .center}

Initially, the root node is added to the queue with an index of 0. 
If the queue has elements, it is traversed using a while statement.
<br>

```cpp
int sz = static_cast<int>(que.size());
```
Before traversing the tree, you need to store the size of the queue in a variable. 
This size corresponds to the number of nodes at each level of the tree.
<br>

```cpp
auto first = que.front().second;
```
The "first" variable corresponds to the index of the leftmost node. 
Because we need to calculate width (the difference between the leftmost and rightmost nodes) of each level,
we store the index of the first node in memory before traversing the level.
<br>

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++)
{
	auto p = que.front();
	que.pop();

	auto k = p.second - first;

	if (sz - 1 == i)
	{
		diff = k;
	}
	...
}
```
Traversing the levels of the tree using a loop.
Pay attention to the variable "k." Initially, "k" is always 0 as it represents the difference from the index of the first node.
The variable "k" represents the number of nodes up to the p.second node.
The variable "k" is used when calculating the index of next level of the tree.
Variable "diff" is representing difference between most right node and most left node.
You can calculate the width by adding 1 to the "diff" variable.
<br>

```cpp
if (p.first->left)
{
	que.push({ p.first->left , (2 * k) + 1 });
}
if (p.first->right)
{
	que.push({ p.first->right , (2 * k) + 2 });
}
```
Add the node and index of next level to queue.
You can see the formula for calculating the node index at the next level.

```
(2 * k) + 1 // left node index from parent node
(2 * k) + 2 // right node index from parent node
```
As mentioned above, The variable "k" is used when calculating the index of next level.
As the tree is a binary search tree, you need to multiply the variable "k" by 2.
<br>

```cpp
ret = std::max(ret, diff + 1 /* width */);
```
After traversing each level, update the maximum width of the tree.
Width is diff + 1.

<h2> Complexity Analysis </h2>

* Time complexity: $O(N)$
  <br> Since we traverse all nodes of the tree, the time complexity is $O(N)$.

* Space complexity: $O(N)$
  <br> As we use a queue for BFS traversal, the space complexity is also $O(N)$.

<br><br>


<h2> Conclusion </h2>

Today I showed you how to traverse binary search tree with BFS.
There are many ways to traverse a tree, but many problems in leetcode require you to use BFS to traverse the tree.
so you must know how to traverse trees with bfs.
