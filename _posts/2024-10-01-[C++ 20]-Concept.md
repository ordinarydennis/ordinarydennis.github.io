We often come across template code during development. The standard libraries we frequently use are also mostly developed using templates. However, such template code is often used in ways that differ from the developer's original intention, and it can be difficult to identify the cause when errors occur.<br>
Today, I will explain the Concept introduced in C++20 for the first time and discuss why we should use it.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
T add(T a, T b)
{
    return a + b;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << add(5, 3) << std::endl;
    std::cout << add(2.5, 3.3) << std::endl;
}
```
Now, a template function for addition operation on the same types is given. The initial developer of this function wanted it to perform addition only on numeric types such as integers and floats.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

template<typename T>
T add(T a, T b)
{
    return a + b;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << add(std::string("Hello, "), std::string("World")) << std::endl;   
}
```
However, the user of the function used it for string types, which differed from the initial developer's intention. However, no errors occurred, and the function worked as expected.(In such cases, the user of the function may not realize that they have used the function incorrectly.) In the code above, the add function has no constraints on the type T and simply performs addition on the two arguments

In this case, the add function not only supports int and float types, but also supports string types that have the + operator. In this case, the function is used differently from the initial developer's intention, and it may cause errors during the maintenance of the template code.Let’s look at another example.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template<typename T>
T add(T a, T b)
{
    return a + b;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << add(std::vector<int>{1, 2}, std::vector<int>{3, 4}) << std::endl;
}
```

```
Error	C2679	binary '<<': no operator found which takes a right-hand operand of type 'T' (or there is no acceptable conversion)
```

This case involves using the `std::vector<int>` type with an add template function that supports only integer types. This is also a case where the function is used differently from the initial developer’s intention. Fortunately, when using this function with a type that does not have a defined addition operation, such as std::vector<int>, a compilation error occurs, and this allows the user to realize the mistake. However, it can be difficult to immediately identify the cause of the error based solely on the error messages

As seen in the two examples above, in template metaprogramming, if there are no clear constraints on the types, the code may compile but exhibit unexpected behavior at runtime, or even if a compile-time error occurs, it can be difficult to immediately identify the cause.
<br><br><br>

<h2> Concept </h2>
“Named sets of such [requirements](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/requires) are called *concepts*. Each concept is a predicate, evaluated at compile time, and becomes a part of the interface of a template where it is used as a constraint:”
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints

According to the official documentation, the definition of a concept is described as a named set of requirements. C++20's concepts greatly enhance the safety and clarity of template code. By using concepts, you can declaratively specify the constraints that template arguments must satisfy, which are checked at compile time. This feature helps prevent type-related errors that can occur during template instantiation and assists in conveying the intended use of templates more clearly.

Let's further improve the above example using concepts.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <concepts>

template<typename T>
concept Numeric = std::is_arithmetic<T>::value; //concept definition

template<Numeric T> // concept usage
T add(T a, T b)
{
    return a + b;
}

int main()
{
		std::cout << add(5, 3) << std::endl;
	  std::cout << add(2.5, 3.3) << std::endl;
	  std::cout << add(std::string("Hello, "), std::string("World")) << std::endl;
	  std::cout << add(std::vector<int>{1, 2}, std::vector<int>{3, 4}) << std::endl;  
}
```

```
Error (active)	E0304	no instance of function template "add" matches the argument list			
```

By using concepts, we can present error messages more clearly. Furthermore, it enhances code readability and allows developers to more clearly convey their intentions to users.
<br><br><br>

<h2>Concept Definition and Usage</h2>

```
template < template-parameter-list >
concept [concept name] = [Constraints requires or type traits]
```

The syntax for defining a concept is as described above. Here, we need to pay attention to two keywords, **concept** and **requires**, and what **type traits** are.

- **concept**: A keyword used to declare a concept. It allows you to define the name of the concept.
- **requires**: The requires keyword is used in two senses: as an **expression** to evaluate the validity of types where it is used, and as a **clause** to apply a concept to a template type. A detailed explanation will be provided in the following chapter.
- **type traits**: Metafunctions used since C++11 to obtain information about types at compile time or to obtain modified types.

<br>

<h3> Concept Clause </h3>
To define a concept, use the concept keyword to declare a name and describe the corresponding constraints.

```
template < template-parameter-list >
concept concept-name attr ﻿(optional) = constraint-expression
```

Below is a defined concept that only applies when the template type is 4 bytes

```cpp
template <class T>
concept Type4Byte = sizeof(T) == 4;
```

The definition of a concept is simple. Just specify the concept keyword, name, and constraints
- concept : Keyword for declaring a concept.
- Type4Byte : Name of concept
- sizeof(T) == 4 : Constraints of concept


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <concepts>

template <class T>
concept Type4Byte = sizeof(T) == 4;

template<Type4Byte T>
void func(T type) { }

int main()
{
	int i = 4;
	float f = 12.f;
	double d = 12.f;

	func(i);
	func(f);
	func(d);
}
```

```
Error	C2672	'func': no matching overloaded function found
```

An error message is occurring because there is no overloaded function that matches the double type. Since the double type is 8 bytes in size, the template function was not created, and thus an error occurs when used. By utilizing concepts, constraints can be placed on the template type to prevent misuse by the function user.

Concepts cannot recursively refer to themselves and cannot be constrained

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept V = V<T*>; // error: recursive concept
 
template<class T>
concept C1 = true;
template<C1 T>
concept Error1 = true; // Error: C1 T attempts to constrain a concept definition
template<class T> requires C1<T>
concept Error2 = true; // Error: the requires clause attempts to constrain a concept

```
<br>

<h3> Requires Clauses </h3>
The keyword requires is used to introduce a requires clause, which specifies constraints on template arguments or on a function declaration.

The expression must have one of the following forms
- A primary expression, e.g. Swappable<T>, std::is_integral<T>::value, (std::is_object_v<Args> && ...), or any parenthesized expression.
	``` cpp
	#include <concepts>
	template <class T> requires std::is_integral<T>::value
	int Add(T a, T b)
	{
		return a + b;
	}
	```

- A sequence of primary expressions joined with the operator &&.
	```cpp
	#include <concepts>
	#include <type_traits>

	template <class T> 
	requires std::is_integral<T>::value && std::is_signed<T>::value
	int Add(T a, T b)
	{
		return a + b;
	}
	```

- A sequence of aforementioned expressions joined with the operator ||.
	```cpp
	#include <concepts>
	#include <type_traits>

	template <class T> 
	requires std::is_integral<T>::value || std::is_floating_point<T>::value
	int Add(T a, T b)
	{
		return a + b;
	}
	```

Requires clauses can only use boolean constants that are determined at compile time. Types that can be implicitly cast to bool, such as int and char, cannot be used. 
```cpp
template <class T> requires true  // This has no effect, but it's valid to write like this!!
void foo(T a) {}

template <class T> requires false // This will always return false, so this function can never be used
void foo(T t) {}

template <class T> requires std::is_pointer_v<T> // Direct use of type trait is possible
void foo(T t) {}

template <class T> requires 1 // ERROR!! You cannot use an int
void foo(T t) {}

bool check_error() 
{
return true; 
}

template <class T> requires (check_error()) // ERROR!! Not a constexpr function, hence an error
void foo(T t) {}

constexpr bool check_ok() 
{ 
return true; 
}

template <class T> requires (check_ok()) // OK since it's evaluated at compile time due to constexpr
void foo(T t) {}

template <class T> requires (sizeof(T) > 4) // Direct use of a constant expression is OK
void foo(T t) {}

template <class T>
concept GreaterThan4 = sizeof(T) >= 4;

template <class T> requires GreaterThan4<T> // Using a concept is also OK
void foo(T t) {}

```

<h2> Requires Expression </h2>

```cpp
requires { requirement-seq; }; // In a requires expression, constraints can be specified without any arguments.
requires ( parameter-list ) { requirement-seq; }; // Constraints using parameters are also possible.
```

<h3> Simple Requires Expression </h3>
A simple requires expression, as the name suggests, refers to a basic expression requirement. This expression does not perform actual computations instead, it only determines the syntactic feasibility or infeasibility.

```cpp
template <class T>
concept Comparable1 = requires(T a, T b)
{
    a < b; // It does not evaluate whether 'a' is less than 'b'. It only checks if 'a < b' comparison is possible.
};

template <class T>
concept Comparable = requires(T a, T b)
{
    a < b; // It does not evaluate whether 'a' is less than 'b'. It only checks if 'a < b' comparison is possible.
};

template<Comparable T>
bool Compare(T l, T r)
{
    return l < r;
}

int main()
{
    Compare(1, 2);  // ok
    Compare("aa", "bb"); // ok
    Compare("aa", 123);  // error, incompatible types for comparison
}
```
The example above does not actually evaluate the values of 'a' and 'b' to return true or false. Instead, it assesses whether the '<' operation is possible or not between 'a' and 'b'.
<br><br><br>


<h2> Compound Requires Expression </h2>
**Compound `requires` expressions** allow for the logical combination of multiple conditions to set more complex and specific constraints on template functions or classes. This enables the clear and efficient expression of complex type constraints, enhancing the type safety of the code.

Logical operators AND (**`&&`**), OR (**`||`**), and NOT (**`!`**) are used to combine multiple conditions to verify if the template argument types meet complex requirements through **compound `requires` expressions**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>

// Combines the conditions that the type must be integral and copyable
template<typename T>
concept CopyableIntegral = std::is_integral_v<T> && std::is_copy_constructible_v<T>;

template<typename T>
requires CopyableIntegral<T>  // Must satisfy CopyableIntegral
T add(T a, T b)
{
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << add(5, 10) << std::endl;    // OK, int is integral and copyable
    // std::cout << add(5.5, 10.1) << std::endl;  // Error, double is not an integral type
}

```
The CopyableIntegral concept is a compound expression that combines std::is_integral_v<T> (whether type T is an integral type) and std::is_copy_constructible_v<T> (whether type T is copyable). Thus, a type T must be both integral and copyable to satisfy this concept.

1. AND Compound(&&)
	```cpp
	template<typename T>
	concept ArithmeticAndCopyable = requires(T a, T b) {
		{ a + b } -> std::same_as<T>;          // Addition is possible
		{ a - b } -> std::same_as<T>;          // Subtraction is possible
		std::is_copy_constructible_v<T>;       // Copyable
	};

	template<typename T>
	requires ArithmeticAndCopyable<T>
	T calculate(T a, T b) {
		return (a + b) * (a - b);
	}
	```

	Here, the requires clause combines the conditions that type T must be capable of addition and subtraction, and must be copy constructible, using the AND (&&) operator. The template is instantiated only when all conditions are satisfied.

2. OR Compound(||)
	```cpp
	template<typename T>
	concept AddableOrMultipliable = requires(T a, T b) {
		{ a + b } -> std::same_as<T>;          // Addition is possible
	} || requires(T a, T b) {
		{ a * b } -> std::same_as<T>;          // Multiplication is possible
	};

	template<typename T>
	requires AddableOrMultipliable<T>
	T operate(T a, T b) {
		if constexpr (requires { a + b; }) {
			return a + b;
		} else {
			return a * b;
		}
	}

	```
	In this example, the requires clause uses the OR (||) operator to allow the template to be instantiated only if addition or multiplication is possible.

3. NOT Compound (!)
	```cpp
	template<typename T>
	concept NotFloatingPoint = !std::is_floating_point_v<T>;

	template<NotFloatingPoint T>
	T negate(T a) {
		return -a;
	}

	```
	Here, the requires clause uses the NOT operator (!) to allow the template to be instantiated only if it is not a floating-point type.
<br><br>

<h2> Nested Requires Expressions </h2>
<b>Nested Requires Expressions</b> refer to the method in C++ of including other concepts within one concept when using Concepts. This allows for the expression of more complex and detailed type constraints.

For example, let's create a concept that defines a type as "an integral type capable of basic arithmetic operations." In this case, you can use the std::integral concept from the C++ standard library to check if the type is integral and, additionally, verify if it is capable of basic arithmetic operations.

```cpp
#include <concepts>

template <typename T>
concept IntegralAndArithmetic = requires(T x, T y) {
    requires std::integral<T>;  // Checks if T is an integral type
    { x + y } -> std::same_as<T>;  // Addition must be possible
    { x - y } -> std::same_as<T>;  // Subtraction must be possible
    { x * y } -> std::same_as<T>;  // Multiplication must be possible
    { x / y } -> std::same_as<T>;  // Division must be possible
};


int main() {
    static_assert(IntegralAndArithmetic<int>, "int should satisfy IntegralAndArithmetic");
    static_assert(!IntegralAndArithmetic<double>, "double should not satisfy IntegralAndArithmetic");
}
```

This code demonstrates that the int type satisfies the IntegralAndArithmetic concept, but the double type does not. Thus, nested requires expressions allow for the systematic verification of complex conditions for types.

<h2> Changes Due to the Introduction of Concepts </h2>

1. **Readability and Declarative Style**: Using `concept` allows you to define type requirements more clearly, making the code easier to read and understand. The code itself serves as documentation.
2. **Improved Error Messages**: With `concept`, you can provide clearer error messages that explain the issues more precisely when compilation errors occur, making debugging easier.
3. **Code Conciseness**: `concept` reduces the amount of code needed to check type traits, thereby simplifying the code. This helps in enhancing the maintainability of the project.
4. **More Powerful Template Tools**: `concept` enables more intuitive type constraints than traditional SFINAE, making template metaprogramming more powerful.

In conclusion, the introduction of `concept` enhances the accessibility of C++ template programming and makes template metaprogramming easier and more efficient. It aids programmers in applying type constraints more easily and in writing more stable and understandable code.
<br><br><br>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
Today, we explored one of the new features of C++20, the concept, which clarifies the intent of code and reduces the complexity associated with using templates. I hope that your template code becomes more powerful and easier to understand. We will continue to explore other new features of C++ in future posts. See you in the next post!
