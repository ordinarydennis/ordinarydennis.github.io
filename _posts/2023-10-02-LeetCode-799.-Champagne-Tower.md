We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the <b>first</b> row has `1` glass, the <b>second</b> row has `2` glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup of champagne.

Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.  When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)

For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the jth glass in the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.)


<b>Example 1:</b>
```
Input: poured = 1, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1
Output: 0.00000
Explanation: We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). 
There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty.
```

<b>Example 2:</b>
```
Input: poured = 2, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1
Output: 0.50000
Explanation: We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. 
The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange.
```

<b>Example 3:</b>
```
Input: poured = 100000009, query_row = 33, query_glass = 17
Output: 1.00000
```

<h2>Analysis</h2>
This problem is to find out the amount of champagne left in a specific glass which is placed at query_row, query_glass. 
My first approach is to subtract the amount of champagne equal to the number of glasses and then dividing the remaining champagne into the remaining glasses.

<h2>Simulation</h2>

![simulation_1]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2023-10-02-LeetCode-799.-Champagne-Tower/simulation_1.png)
<br>
Suppose there are six glasses on table and champagne that can be poured the amount of four glasses.

![simulation_2]({{site.url}}/assets/img/2023-10-02-LeetCode-799.-Champagne-Tower/simulation_2.png)
<br>
When you pour champagne into the top glass, one glass is filled and there are three glasses champagne left. The amount of champagne that can be poured from first row to second row is 1.5 in each glass.

<br>
The second row glasses is filled and remaining champagne is poured to glasses in next row. The middle of glass at third row should be multiplied 2 because it can get champagne from two glasses at second row. Let's  create the above simulation as code.


<h2> Solution </h2>

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
	double champagneTower(int poured, int query_row, int query_glass) {

		std::vector<double> cur(1, poured);

		for (int i = 0; i <= query_row; i++)
		{
			std::vector<double> next(i + 2, 0);

			for (int a = 0; a <= i; a++)
			{
				if (1 <= cur[a])
				{
					next[a] += (cur[a] - 1) / 2.0;
					next[a + 1] += (cur[a] - 1) / 2.0;
					cur[a] = 1;
				}
			}

			if (i != query_row)
			{
				cur = next;
			}
		}

		return cur[query_glass];

	}
};

```
cur is vector<double>. It represents the amount of champagne at current row.


```cpp
for (int i = 0; i <= query_row; i++)
{
	std::vector<double> next(i + 2, 0);
	...
```
The index of first row is 0. The amount of champagne left should be filled when a glass of first is filled as well. So you need to create next variable as vector<double>.
<br>

Here is the most important code in this problem.
```cpp
for (int a = 0; a <= i; a++)
{
	if (1 <= cur[a])
	{
		next[a] += (cur[a] - 1) / 2.0;
		next[a + 1] += (cur[a] - 1) / 2.0;
		cur[a] = 1;
	}
}
```
This code represents to divide the amount champagne in each glass of current row into two glasses in next row. And then a current glass is filled with 1.

```cpp
if (i != query_row)
{
	cur = next;
}
```
We need to change cur to next to fill the glasses in the next row. but you don’t need to change at last row because you need remaining champagne information in last row.

```cpp
return cur[query_glass];
```
If you fill champagne to all glasses, all you need to return the amount of champagne at query_glass position of the cur.

<h2> Complexity Analysis </h2>
- Time Complexity: O(R^2), where R is the number of rows. As this is fixed, we can consider this complexity to be O(1).
- Space Complexity: O(R^2), or O(1) by the reasoning above.
<br><br>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
When I looked at the solution, I could understand it easily and solved it easily. But When I first encountered this problem, I didn't know how to approach. I realized I needed to practice more.
